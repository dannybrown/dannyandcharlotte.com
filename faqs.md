## How do I RSVP?
Please email rsvp@dannyandcharlotte.com, if you are a day guest please include any dietary requirements and your menu choices. If you have any song requests please feel free to send them our way!

## What should I wear?
We'd love to see everyone dressed in their best for the occasion! Just a note that the venue insists any stiletto shoes inside the house have to have heel protectors to protect the floors. We will be providing some, please put them over your heels when you arrive should that be your choice of footwear. 

## Should we bring gifts?
Your presence at our big day is the best gift you could possibly give us! We would much prefer you put the money into an amazing fascinator or hat instead. There will be a postbox for cards and a guestbook at the venue which we would love for you to sign.

## Are kids allowed?
You are welcome to come with (or without) your children! The drawing room in the main house (the one with the big dining table) will be available as a quiet room should anyone be feeling a bit overwhelmed or want a quiet chat with a relative :) We would appreciate if the late evening when everyone's had a few was child free, though.

## How will the fascinator and hat competition be judged?
The categories of scoring will be:
- overall presentation
- whether you made it yourself
- colourfulness

But please, for the love of god, don't make it steampunk. Applications for being judgemental to be submitted on the back of a postcard, or with your RSVP. 

### What do we win?
Bragging rights, of course!

## Will Konnie Huq be there?
Unfortunately Konnie can't make it, but she'll be sending a stand in Z list celebrity instead. She wishes everyone well and sends her apologies.
