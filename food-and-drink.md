In case you've not headed this way before and you're wondering where to go the day before or day after, here are some of our favourite local restaurants and drinking establishments.

# Proper pubs
- [The Cock Inn, Broom](https://www.thecockinnbroom.com): brown signs from the road as it's a historic pub with "no bar" - just a keg room with a table in front of it. Great rotating selection of beers. Roast of the day available every day!
- [The Anchor, Great Barford](https://www.anchorinngreatbarford.co.uk): riverside pub next to the bridge of many arches. Common for people to get takeaway food and beers and sit by the river.
- Couple of nice pubs in Gamlingay we've been meaning to check out, report back if you make it up that way!

# Cheap and cheerful
- Crown hotel, Biggleswade: Wetherspoons.
- Beego's cafe, Biggleswade: really good sandwich shop
- The Ghandi (in Sandy) - great Indian. Friendly owners and staff.
- Onsite Shuttleworth collection cafe - should be accessible to all guests any day.

# More "brunch"-y
- [The Coach House, Potton](https://www.coachhousepotton.co.uk): nice brunch and lunch style food, somewhat american in style.
- [Rosso Lounge, Biggleswade](https://thelounges.co.uk/rosso/): does great brunch, good homemade drinks and a very broad menu covering lunch and dinner. Part of a chain
- [Woodview Farmshop, Gamlingay](https://www.woodviewfarm.co.uk): nice cafe and butchery with a good selection of produce.

# Gastropubs and a taproom
- [The John O'Gaunt Pub, Sutton](http://www.johnogauntsutton.co.uk): Off the beaten track pub past a ford. Really good food, listed in the Michellin guide. Good range of food and great quality. Booking via email recommended.
- [Saddle and Spoke, Biggleswade](https://saddleandspoke.com) does nice cocktails, very nice staff. London Pride on tap. Same building (and owners) as the stratton house hotel.
- [The Hare and Hound, Old Warden](https://www.hareandhoundsoldwarden.com): the only pub in the village on the Shuttleworth estate. Good selection of local brews, mostly from Bedford. Food is excellent.
- [The Black Horse at Ireland](https://blackhorseireland.com): really good food. Really nice professional waiters. 
- [Drink Biggleswade](https://www.drinkbiggleswade.co.uk): if you're after a broad selection of more modern, stronger beers this is the place to go. Being a taproom the prices are a little higher than the pubs, but it's a small and sociable bar and they'll give you tasters of whatever you ask for. Sells tinnies which can be taken away or drunk in, as well as 5 rotating beers on tap. 

# Misc
- [O'Sarracino, Potton and Biggleswade](https://osarracino.co.uk): small family run italian in a wood beam building in Potton, and another in a slightly more modern building in Biggleswade. Booking recommended, especially in Potton.
- [Pera Kitchen, Biggleswade](https://www.perakitchen.com): Turkish, good food, good atmosphere.
