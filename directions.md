## Taxis
If you're not staying at the venue we recommend prebooking all taxis, as phone signal in this part of Bedfordshire is particularly bad. The closest taxi company is Village cars, you can book them online [using this website](https://village-taxis.com). Make sure you put in Shuttleworth House rather than the collection.

## Driving
From the A1 at the Sainsbury's Biggleswade junction follow signs for Old Warden. Ignore signs for Shuttleworth Collection as this the entrance to the main collection. Proceed into the village and you will reach a gatehouse in the village centre with green signs for Shuttleworth House and "wedding". Parking for residents is in the car park, parking for guests will be on the grass (this will be well signed).

## By train
Take the train to Biggleswade, which is easily accessed from London or Peterborough. Get a taxi to Shuttleworth House.

## Airports
closest are Luton and Stansted, these are both around 40 mins taxi. Most easily accessed by public transport from Gatwick (though probably slightly further than Heathrow) as it's a direct train to Biggleswade.
