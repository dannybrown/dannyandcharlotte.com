**Signal is limited once you leave the A1 in Biggleswade, so pre booking taxis to and from the venue is advised.**

# Closest
- [Black Horse at Ireland](https://blackhorseireland.com): Ireland, Bedfordshire that is! Very good quality food, rooms include continental breakfast. 
- [Estate housing](https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/landmark-groups/old-warden/#Search): there are a few landmark to stay around the estate if you're looking for something more unique. All have a minimum stay of Friday to Sunday and are a bit more expensive, though. 

Ireland is about a 5 minute taxi or an hour's stumble down an unlit country road (not advised!). The houses on the estate are about a 15 minute walk. 

# Biggleswade
- [Stratton House Hotel](https://www.strattonhouse-hotel.co.uk): Fairly traditional central hotel in Biggleswade built in the 17th century.
- [The Crown Hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/the-crown-wetherspoon.en-gb.html): Wetherspoons, central Biggleswade. Rooms are "very nice" according to local reviews.
- Stratton Guest House: a bit more basic but comfortable rooms. Very close to the train station
- Chic House: I imagine similar to the Guest House. These two are buildings opposite each other

All hotels in Biggleswade will be about a 15 minute taxi drive from the venue, and around about £10 before 11 or £15 after.

# Close by villages
If looking for anything else it is best to stick in Shefford, Langford, Old Warden, Henlow or Ireland, (aka, the west side of the A1), as these are easiest to reach from the venue. Plenty of options on Booking.com or by searching "hotels near shuttleworth house" on Google maps.

# Further afield
- [Mercure Hotel, Letchworth](https://all.accor.com/hotel/7243/index.en.shtml?dateIn=&nights=&compositions=1&stayplus=false&snu=false#origin=mercure): fairly nice hotel in a very nice building. Have been in for a drink whilst charging our EV once or twice!
- [Premier Inn, Letchworth](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/hertfordshire/letchworth-garden-city/letchworth-garden-city.html)
- Plenty of other places to stay in Stevenage, Hitchin, Letchworth or Baldock, all of which would be a 20-30 minute taxi.
